## What is a Measurement Framework?
A measurement framework is a structured approach to defining what success looks like for your business and how you will track progress towards it. It helps you identify the right Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that align with your strategic objectives. Without a clear framework, you risk measuring too much or too little, leading to confusion and inefficient use of resources.

A well-defined framework ensures that everyone in the organization understands what is being measured, why it's being measured, and how it contributes to the overall goals.

## Step 1: Identify Business Objectives
The first and most critical step is to clearly define your business objectives. What are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to increase revenue, improve customer satisfaction, enhance operational efficiency, or grow market share? Your objectives should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

For example, instead of a vague objective like "improve sales," a SMART objective would be "increase online sales by 15% in the next quarter." This clarity is essential for selecting relevant KPIs.
